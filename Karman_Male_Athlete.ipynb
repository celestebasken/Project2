    "# Chronic Energy Deficits: Female athletes often experience chronic low energy availability (LEA), leading to conditions like relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S), which impacts performance, bone density, menstrual health, and immune function. This is less emphasized in male athletes.\n",
    "# Nutritional Interventions: There is a need for sex-specific nutritional strategies to address the unique challenges faced by female athletes, including managing energy deficits and supporting bone and reproductive health. Male athletes might focus more on macronutrient intake to maximize muscle synthesis and recovery.\n",
    "# Protein and Amino Acid Needs: Female athletes may require adjusted protein doses and specific attention to amino acid intake to support muscle repair, recovery, and overall energy levels, particularly in endurance sports. Men, on the other hand, may benefit from higher protein doses due to differences in muscle protein synthesis influenced by hormonal factors like testosterone.\n",
    "# Lipid Metabolism: Female athletes show different patterns of lipid utilization, which could impact their energy availability and recovery, especially in endurance sports. Tailored dietary interventions that optimize lipid profiles could therefore be more critical for female endurance athletes.\n",

    "# While total energy needs of female athletes are lower than male athletes, macronutrient needs tend to be similar relative to body size (i.e. g per kg body mass).\n",
    "# Macronutrient utilization may vary over the course of a menstrual cycle; however, the overall effect appears to be small and can be minimized with proper fueling.\n",
    "# Micronutrient needs of female athletes differ from male athletes, and the risk of deficiency should be considered in the development of nutrition plans.\n",
